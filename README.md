# Kingshot Discord Bot

## üéÆ What is this?
A comprehensive Discord bot for Kingshot alliance management, featuring gift code redemption, member tracking, event notifications, and more. This bot is specifically designed for [Kingshot](https://www.centurygames.com/games/kingshot/).

## üñ•Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **[Python 3.9 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to run the bot**
- Can be run on Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, a Docker container, or even on your mobile phone
- System requirements are minimal (at least until captcha is added to the gift code site)
- No GPU required - all processing is CPU-based
- Stable internet connection required

## üöÄ Installation

> Detailed installation and hosting guides are available on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HFnNnQWnbS). Come join the community!

**Before following the steps below, you should have already completed the bot setup on the Discord Application Portal.** If not, please first do the following Bot Creation steps.

### Bot Creation Process
1. Go to the [Discord Application Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Click **New Application**, name it, and click **Create**.
Add an App Icon and Description if you like.
This determines how your Bot will appear on your Discord server.

3. On the left, go to **Settings > OAuth2**, and under **OAuth2 URL Generator**, select:
* ‚úÖ bot

4. A **Bot Permissions** window will open below, select:
* ‚úÖ Administrator

Next to the Generated URL at the bottom of the page, click **Copy** and then paste the URL into your web browser.

5. Select your Discord server and follow the steps to add the bot to the server.

6. Go back to the **Discord Application Portal** and make sure your bot is selected.

7. Click on **Bot** on the left settings menu.

8. On the page that opens, under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:

* ‚úÖ Server Members Intent
* ‚úÖ Message Content Intent
* ‚úÖ Presence Intent

9. Click **Reset Token**, confirm, and copy the bot token.

10. Save this token in a text file named `bot_token.txt`. **Keep it safe!** You will also need it later on in the instructions.

### Bot Installation Steps

1. **Download the Bot files from Github, for example with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justncodes/Kingshot-Discord-Bot.git
   cd Kingshot-Discord-Bot
   ```

2. **Install Bot Token:**
    Place the `bot_token.txt` file that you saved during the steps above into the Kingshot-Discord-Bot directory that your bot files are located in. If you don't, the bot will prompt you for the token during first start.
  
3. **Start the Bot:**
   Run the bot using Python from the command line. The bot will automatically install required dependencies when you first run it:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

    * If you intend to run the bot headless (as a service), you can add the `--autoupdate` argument to skip the update prompt on restart:
  
   ```bash
   python main.py --autoupdate
   ```

4. **Initial Setup:**
   - Run `/settings` in Discord to configure yourself as the main administrator
   - Run `/settings` again to open the bot configuration menu
   - Use `/w [player-id]` for player lookup based on their ID

### Upgrading from previous versions

If you're using a previous version, **you only need to restart the bot** and accept the prompt asking you whether you want to update. The update should be seamless. If you prefer to skip the prompt, run the bot with the `--autoupdate` argument shown in the installation steps above.
